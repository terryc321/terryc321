## About Me

Self taught developer with passion for programming.

Looking at what uses javascript and is currently popular and REACT naturally came up.

Followed the REACT tutorial which to me seemed overly convoluted about moving classes down and then out back up again.

Currently learning the REACT framework using Leiningen + Clojurescript + Hiccup + Reagent.

Using Emacs server + Emacs clients + Cider + Paredit + Ivy + Company + Figwheel / Figwheel-main

- [x] simple svg 3 by 3 grid viewport
- [x] winner
- [ ] see Timothy Pratley on youtube with Clojurescript

# Temperature App : change fahrenheit affects celsius reading.  change celsius affects fahrenheit reading.



# SVG Clock : uses setInterval every half second , uses Date object so time is actually accurate.
 it works as a clock.
 
# Breakout :  clojurescript + svg , ground to halt when too many svg to render. simple rectangles.

# Breakout2 : clojurescript + canvas api (using form-3 format). canvas performs well for lots of entities.


## Reflections on August 2019 and learning Clojurescript


Clojurescript is a really nice language.

There can be a issue if try to write too much clojurescript at once , the debugging is not really up to the task.  Its as if the
debugger cannot really find what is issue.

If change config it requires restarting figwheel , which i dont really understand why that has to happen.

The only problem is when for hiccup rendering it requires an actual concrete list rather than a lazy sequence , so have
to remember to put a doall clause around it.


### Programming Background , Experience and Thoughts

Been using modern linux operating system for about twenty years.

programming knowledge spans a broad spectrum from low level x86 assembly code up to visual basic on microsoft excel.

Mainly used linux because it gave me access to a very good programming environment , shells , text editor emacs , latex , mathematical software
to allow me to carry on my Open University engineering long distance degree.

one interesting piece of software that i would like to see is traceability of



Motivated to solve engineering problems , looking at using

```lisp
(define f 1)

(define g (lambda (n) (+ f n)))
```



0 JAVASCRIPT - just a dreadful language design with some gems , just dont fall into the many many bear traps of the language.

1 BASH - understand shell scripts , how execute them , pitfalls.

2 SQL (Structured Query Language) - wrote MySQL queries for family member working at medical surgery to 

3 C Language Experience - good firm understanding of the C language , pointers and  memory , familiar with Gnu Compiler GCC.

4 C++ Language - a superset of C , probably take me time to get up to speed. 

5 Python 2 / 3 Language - 

6 Perl Language - written some simple scripts parse a file using regular expressions. readability of programs is a major issue.

7 PHP Language - simple scripts such as login authentication , populate and query mysql databases

8 JAVA - used AWT for simple task , very heavy class orientated design , a lot of boiler plate.

9 SMALLTALK - amazing once weird syntax is understood, too difficult to write smoothly.



functional by design languages 

10 STANDARD ML

11 OCAML

12 HASKELL - write a factorial in these languages but it is so much 



L.A.M.P Stack (Linux Apache MySQL Php) Experience

L.L.M.P Stack (Linux Lighttpd MySQL Php) Experience

- Able to setup a basic web server including apache or lighttpd

- Set up mysql database users and passwords

- Create required tables   

- Populate database using perl cgi , php 

- Query database using SQL (Structured Query Language) such as select * from table where id = "foo"



Some mathematical languages



maple - flaky , can write program for hundred lines and then unmaintainable , starts failing for no apparent reason.

axiom - nice , strictly typed proprietary.

maxima - subset of axiom , very niche.
